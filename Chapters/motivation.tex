\chapter{Motivation}

According to outlined above in section \ref{ch:EB_p}, one of the reasons of eclipsing binary system period change is a light time travel effect or presence of $3^{rd}$ in EB system. That's why I decide to investigate existence of brawn dwarfs and circumbinary planets in eclipsing binary systems.

In next sections of my PhD thesis I will briefly describe O-C diagram tool as a instrument for detection of period changes in EB systems. 
I will investigate all factors that has a influence on O-C diagram shape, and thus affect on determination of orbital parameters of brawn dwarfs and circumbinary planets that can exist in EB system.
These factors are -- EB system visibility from observational point, weather conditions, precision of photometry, presents of spots on EB component, or on both components, pulsations in eclipsing binaries.

something more ... simulation  $10^6$   


Using all described above knowledge distortion presented on O-C diagrams of eclipsing binary systems I will try to search brawn dwarfs and circumbinary planets in eclipsing binary systems using Kepler eclipsing binaries catalogue or from ground based observations.
