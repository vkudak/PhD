The outline of this work is as follows. 
Chapter~\ref{Chapter1} describes classification of eclipsing bi\-na\-ries. 
We focus our attention on EBs because they are the most convenient type of \mbox{binary} stars to find circumbinary planets and brown dwarfs.
In Chapter~\ref{Chapter_exo}, the definition of exo\-planets and brown dwarfs is given. The problem of object separation between this two classes is described. Chapter~\ref{Chapter_oc} explains basics of O-C diagrams analysis. Very important for precise build of O-C diagram is determination of minima times, main methods of such task solution is given in Chapter~\ref{Chapter_minima_det}.
In Chapter~\ref{Chapter2} main aspects of Kepler mission are described as our main data source. 
Main objective of Chapter~\ref{Chapter3} is to describe all limitations related to detection of circumbinary planets and brown dwarfs. The process of O-C diagram calculation from data in Kepler EB catalogue is briefly described.
