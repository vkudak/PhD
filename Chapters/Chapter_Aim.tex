In the dissertation thesis we plan to study circumbinary objects discovered in EB systems. 

The particular objectives of our research are specified in the following:

\begin{enumerate}

\item We will analyse Kepler data available in public archive.
\item We will also study influence of intrinsic variability of components and spots on the resulting O-C diagram.  
\item We will determine minima light of EB from Kepler and construct O-C diagram. Based on the shape of O-C diagram decision regarding presents of
another body in the system will be made. 
\item Parameters of other bodies in selected systems will be calculated.  


\end{enumerate}
